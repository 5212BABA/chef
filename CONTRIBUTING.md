# Contribution Guidelines

## Workflow

We operate the "Fork & Pull" model explained at

https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

You should fork the project into your own repo, create a topic branch
there and then make one or more pull requests back to the openstreetmap/chef repository.
Your pull requests will then be reviewed and discussed.
